/**
 * Think of Roaring Bitmap as a smart container system that efficiently stores and manages large sets of numbers
 * by using different storage strategies based on the data patterns.
 * It splits numbers into "chunks" of 2ยนโถ (65,536) values
 * First 16 bits: Used as "chunk" number
 * Last 16 bits: Used as position within chunk
 * 1. Array for sparse data:
 * If few numbers in chunk: Store as sorted array
 * Example: [1,2,3] for first few integers
 *
 * 2. Bitmap for dense data:
 * If many numbers in chunk: Use traditional bitmap
 * Example: lots of numbers between 65,536-131,071
 *
 * 3. Run containers for sequences:
 * If consecutive numbers: Store as ranges
 * Example: Store 1-1000 as [1,1000] instead of 1000 values
