 * A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in

 * A node can only appear in the sequence at most once.
 * Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
 *
 * The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.

/**
 * First, ask yourself which tree traversal strategy you will use. Preorder, Inorder, or Postorder?
 *
 * In our case, to calculate the max path sum for a given node,
 * we need to know the max path of the left and right subtrees first. Therefore, we will be using a postorder traversal.
 *
 * In the post order traversal, we need to account for two things:
 *
 * Global Maximum Path Sum:
 * This considers the current node as the root of the path and includes contributions from both its left and right subtrees.
 * This value gives the highest path sum if the path is allowed to "turn" at the current node.
 * Current Path Sum: This is the maximum path sum at the current node that can continue upwards to its parent.
 * A parent node can only use one of its child's paths in its calculation.
 * For clarity:
 *
 * If a subtree's contribution is negative, it's better to ignore it entirely, as adding it would reduce the overall sum.
 * At each node, we calculate two values:
 * Maximum path sum considering the node as the root: node.val + leftMaxPath + rightMaxPath.
 * Path sum for continuation: node.val + max(leftMaxPath, rightMaxPath).
 * Approach
 * Hereâ€™s how we can implement this efficiently using a recursive helper function:
 *
 * Base Case: If a node is Null, its contribution to the path sum is 0.
 * Recursive Step: At each node:
 * Calculate the maximum path sum for the left and right subtrees.
 * Ignore any subtree that has a negative contribution by taking max(leftSubtreeSum, 0) and max(rightSubtreeSum, 0).
 * Compute the maximum path sum considering the current node as the root: node.val + leftMaxPath + rightMaxPath.
 * Update the global maximum if this value is greater than the previously recorded maximum.
 * Return Value: For the parent node, return the maximum path sum that can continue to be part of a larger path: node.val + max(leftMaxPath, rightMaxPath).
 * Example Walkthrough
 *     -10
 *     /  \
 *    9   20
 *       /  \
 *      15   7
 * Recursive Steps
 * At Node 9:
 *
 * Both left and right children are None, so their contributions are 0.
 * The maximum path sum considering 9 as root is 9 + 0 + 0 = 9.
 * For continuation, the contribution is 9 + max(0, 0) = 9.
 * At Node 15:
 *
 * Both left and right children are None, so their contributions are 0.
 * The maximum path sum considering 15 as root is 15 + 0 + 0 = 15.
 * For continuation, the contribution is 15 + max(0, 0) = 15.
 * At Node 7:
 *
 * Both left and right children are None, so their contributions are 0.
 * The maximum path sum considering 7 as root is 7 + 0 + 0 = 7.
 * For continuation, the contribution is 7 + max(0, 0) = 7.
 * At Node 20:
 *
 * Left subtree contributes 15, right subtree contributes 7.
 * The maximum path sum considering 20 as root is 20 + 15 + 7 = 42.
 * For continuation, the contribution is 20 + max(15, 7) = 35.
 * At Node -10:
 *
 * Left subtree contributes 9, right subtree contributes 35.
 * The maximum path sum considering -10 as root is -10 + 9 + 35 = 34.
 * For continuation, the contribution is -10 + max(9, 35) = 25.
 * Final Result
 * The global maximum path sum is 42, achieved at the subtree rooted at 20.
